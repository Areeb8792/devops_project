# Git Multi-User Workflow Simulator

## Introduction
The Git Multi-User Workflow Simulator is a practical project designed to demonstrate how Git is used in real-world collaborative environments.
This project simulates multiple developers working on the same codebase using branches, merges, and conflict resolution, all performed using Git Bash.

The main goal of this project is to understand version control concepts, branch-based development, and handling merge conflicts efficiently.

## Tools Used
Git Bash (for all Git operations)

GitHub (remote repository hosting)

HTML (project content)

CSS (basic styling)

Markdown (documentation)

## Git Commands Used
following git commands were used throughout the project:
git init
git status
git add
git commit
git branch
git checkout
git merge
git log
git remote add
git remote -v
git push
git pull


## Branches Created
The following branches were created to simulate a multi-user workflow:

main:-	Stable production-ready branch
feature:- 	New feature development
test:-	Testing and verification
bugfix:-	Fixing bugs and errors
experiment:-	Experimental changes and conflict simulation


## Merge Conflict
A merge conflict was intentionally created between the main branch and the experiment branch by modifying the same line in index.html.

Steps Followed:

Modified the same content in two different branches

Attempted to merge the branches

Git detected a conflict and stopped the merge

Conflict markers appeared in the file

Manually resolved the conflict using Git Bash

Staged and committed the resolved file

This process demonstrates real-world conflict handling in Git.


## Commit History

The repository contains 10+ meaningful commits

Each commit has a clear and descriptive message

Commits reflect real development steps such as:

Adding features

Fixing bugs

Merging branches

Resolving conflicts

Updating documentation

## Challenges faced

Understanding why merge conflicts occur

Resolving conflicts without deleting important code

Managing multiple branches correctly

Ensuring clean commit history

These challenges helped deepen understanding of Git workflows.


## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates a Git multi-user workflow using branches, merges, and conflict resolution.
By completing this project, I gained practical experience in version control systems and learned industry-standard Git practices.
