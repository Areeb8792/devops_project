  <h2>📌 What This Project Demonstrates</h2>
  <p>
    This simulator models how professional software teams collaborate
    using Git. Each team member works independently on feature branches,
    which are tested and merged systematically to avoid breaking
    production code.

  <h2>⚠️ Merge Conflict Simulation</h2>
  <p>
    Two developers modified the same file line, creating a merge conflict.
    The conflict was resolved manually by reviewing both changes and
    committing the corrected version.
